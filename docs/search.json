    "text": "Question 1: Asking the right questions (12 pts)\nrubric = {completion: 12}\nAn essential part of communication in data science is asking the ‘right’ questions. A good question should stem from a real business problem and reflect the direction of the analysis. As you will see later on in capstone projects, you will be often put in a situation where you need to translate a client’s business interests into a concrete & specific question that determine the direction of the whole project. For example, the client might want to describe some existing patterns in the data, or they want to make inference to a wider population, or they want to predict some outcomes, or they might want to understand if certain interventions have a causal impact on some outcomes. You will need to read between the lines and identify what the client’s interests are to formulate a meaningful question.\nIn this exercise, you will be formulating different types of questions (descriptive, inferential, prediction, causal) to given problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType\nDescription\nQuestion\n\n\n\n\nExploratory\nA question that asks if there are patterns, trends, or relationships within a single data set. Often used to propose hypotheses for future study.\nDoes political party voting change with indicators of wealth in a set of data collected on 2,000 people living in Canada?\n\n\nPredictive\nA question that asks about predicting measurements or labels for individuals (people or things). The focus is on what things predict some outcome, but not what causes the outcome.\nWhat political party will someone vote for in the next Canadian election?\n\n\nInferential\nA question that looks for patterns, trends, or relationships in a single data set and also asks for quantification of how applicable these findings are to the wider population.\nDoes political party voting change with indicators of wealth for all people living in Canada?\n\n\nCausal\nA question that asks about whether changing one factor will lead to a change in another factor, on average, in the wider population.\nDoes wealth lead to voting for a certain political party in Canadian elections?\n\n\n\n\nSource: https://datasciencebook.ca/intro.html#asking-a-question\n\nFor questions 1.1-1.3, FORMAT YOUR ANSWER LIKE THIS:\n\n\n\nType\nQuestion\n\n\n\n\nExploratory\n\n\n\nPredictive\n\n\n\nInferential\n\n\n\nCausal\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1 Problem 1: Real estate marketing\nA digital real estate marketing firm is hiring you as a data science consultant. It offers a comprehensive list of for-sale properties, as well as the information and tools to make informed real estate decisions.\nReturn users are consumers who visit their website more than once. They may return for a variety of reasons such as to discover new homes, search for open houses, know about price reductions, check changes in status of previous homes of interest. These consumers form a very important segment of users since these are the ones we can expect to take more interest in our brand, be more engaged, loyal and, finally convert to a lead.\nIn this project we seek to build a data science/machine learning framework to find users that are likely to return and to develop strategies to encourage them to return to our website.\nANSWER:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType\nQuestion\n\n\n\n\nExploratory\nAre there any patterns in browsing behavior (like time spent or pages viewed) that differ between users who return and those who don’t?\n\n\nPredictive\nBased on a user’s first visit behavior, can we predict whether they’ll come back to our website within the next 30 days?\n\n\nInferential\nDo users who engage with price reduction alerts generally show higher return rates compared to the broader population of our website visitors?\n\n\nCausal\nDoes sending personalized “homes you might like” emails actually cause users to return to our website more often?\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2 Problem 2: Sport analytics\nA professional basketball team is hiring you as a data science consultant. A primary mandate of this team is to inform decisions across several areas of Basketball Operations, including decisions about athletes’ physical preparation, injury prevention, return to sport, player identification/scouting, performance analysis, and opposition scouting.\nThe team collects a large amount of optical tracking data that records the x/y coordinates of all players and the ball at a frequency of 25 frames per second, while the event data records “on-ball” actions throughout the course of a match such as passes, shots.\nIn this project, we seek to apply a data science framework to enhance our players performance and develop effective squad formations that increase our chance of winning games.\nANSWER:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType\nQuestion\n\n\n\n\nExploratory\nWhat movement patterns or passing sequences tend to happen more often in games that we win versus games we lose?\n\n\nPredictive\nGiven the current lineup and play positioning, what’s the expected probability of scoring on this possession?\n\n\nInferential\nDo players who follow our new training regimen show improved shot accuracy across all players in professional basketball?\n\n\nCausal\nDoes implementing a zone defense strategy actually lead to fewer opponent points compared to man-to-man defense?\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3 Problem 3: Learning analytics\nCoursera is hiring you as a data science consultant. The company collects a large amount of event log data from learning management systems, in addition to academic records and personal information. Suppose that while these massive open online courses (MOOCs) have large enrollment, the completion rate has been observed to be rather small.\nIn this project, we are interested in identifying students who are at-risk of dropping out their course and how can we better retain these students.\nANSWER:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType\nQuestion\n\n\n\n\nExploratory\nAre there common patterns in how at-risk students interact with course materials compared to those who complete the course?\n\n\nPredictive\nCan we predict which students are likely to drop out in the next two weeks based on their current engagement metrics?\n\n\nInferential\nIs the relationship between video watch time and course completion rate generalizable to all MOOC learners, not just those in our sample?\n\n\nCausal\nDo reminder notifications actually cause students to be more likely to complete their courses, or do engaged students just happen to respond to them?"

By doing so, you can clearly communicate the results of their analysis and the insights they have gained, helping non-technical audiences to understand the significance and implications of their work. By writing clearly and concisely, data scientists can ensure that their ideas and insights are understood by their colleagues and that they can work together effectively. Finally, it can help you build credibility and trust with your colleagues, and demonstrate the value and relevance of your work.\nHere are some tips for effective writing data science communication:\n\nBe clear and concise: Avoid using jargon or overly technical language, and aim to explain concepts in a simple and straightforward manner.\nUse examples: Illustrate your points with examples or case studies to help make the material more relatable and easier to understand.\nBreak down complex concepts If you are explaining a complex concept, break it down into smaller, more manageable pieces and explain each piece separately.\nUse visual aids: Use charts, graphs, or other visual aids to help clarify and illustrate your points.\nAsk for feedback: Review your writing carefully to ensure that it is accurate and well-organized, and ask for feedback from others if needed.\n\nIn this exercise, you are tasked to explain your topic of choice to a non-technical audience (a type of activity that you will find yourself doing frequently later on when you work as a data scientist). For this exercise, you should be aiming for a character count of around 2500 (+ or - 500) characters, not including code, captions, references, etc. Please consider the amount of time it will take your audience to read your post (about 5-10 minutes). Consider the following points before diving into your write-up:\n\nIdentify and highlight technical jargon and complex terms that might not be easy to understand by non-technical audiences. Please keep in mind the audience that you are writing for.\nRefine the outline for your write-up.\nRewrite and explain the concept in a clear and concise way, creating additional visual aids if necessary.\n\n\nNote: Used Gemini 3 Pro for proofreading and formatting of content/smoothing upto a certain extent."

    "text": "Paper Trading and Algorithmic Trading: The Why and How.\nWhat if you could Practice Investing Without Losing Money?\nMost people are curious about investing but intimidated by the risk of losing money. This is where paper trading comes in. It is a method of simulating trades using fake money while tracking real market prices. Think of it as training wheels for the stock market. You get all the learning experience without any of the financial pain.\nHowever, one major issue with traditional trading is that humans are emotional. When the market drops, people tend to panic and sell. When a stock is skyrocketing, greed kicks in and they buy at the peak. These emotional decisions often lead to poor results. Studies show that most individual investors actually underperform the market because of these behavioral mistakes.\nThis is why algorithmic trading has become so popular. Instead of making decisions based on gut feelings, an algorithm follows a set of predefined rules based purely on data. The algorithm doesn’t panic. It doesn’t get greedy. It simply executes the strategy it was programmed to follow.\nOne approach is called momentum trading, which is surprisingly simple: stocks that have been going up tend to keep going up, and stocks that have been falling tend to keep falling. However, a more advanced approach involves using Machine Learning to find hidden patterns in the data.\nOne popular machine learning method is called XGBoost. To understand how it works, imagine you are trying to guess whether it will rain tomorrow. You might ask a series of yes/no questions: Is it cloudy? Is the humidity high? Was it raining yesterday? Each question helps narrow down the answer. XGBoost works in a similar way. It builds hundreds of these “question trees” and combines their answers to make a final prediction. Each tree learns from the mistakes of the previous one, gradually improving accuracy. In trading, XGBoost can analyze factors like recent price movements, trading volume, and market trends to predict whether a stock will go up or down.\nThe beauty of machine learning is that it can spot patterns that humans might miss. However, it is not perfect. Just because a model worked on past data doesn’t mean it will work in the future. Markets change, and what worked yesterday may fail tomorrow. This is why testing strategies using paper trading is so important. You can see how the model performs in real conditions without risking actual money.\nAdditionally, it is important to understand transaction costs. Every time you buy or sell a stock, you pay a small fee. These fees seem tiny, maybe a few dollars, but they add up fast when you’re trading frequently. Many seemingly “profitable” strategies actually lose money in practice because the fees eat away at the returns.\nTo summarize, paper trading allows anyone to experiment with investing ideas safely. Machine learning, like XGBoost, can help find hidden patterns and make predictions. And understanding transaction costs reveals whether a strategy is truly profitable or just an illusion."

It also fosters a sense of community and a safe environment to collaborate and help each other with constructive feedback.\nRead the write-ups from Question 3 carefully, paying attention to the content, organization, and style of the writing. Consider the following questions as you review:\n\nIs the content of the write-up accurate and well-researched?\nIs the structure of the write-up clear and logical?\nAre the ideas in the write-up effectively communicated and easy to understand?\nIs the writing style of the write-up engaging and appropriate for the audience?\n\nWrite a review for each of the write-ups, addressing the above questions and any other issues you feel are relevant. Use specific examples to support your points. Reviews should be at least 250 words in length. Please be sure your feedback is positive, constructive, and focused on helping your peers strengthen their work."

The temptation to check your portfolio every five minutes. The regret after making a decision you knew was emotional.\nThis experience got me thinking: what if I could take emotions out of the equation entirely?

    "text": "What Even Is Paper Trading?\nBefore diving into automation, let me explain paper trading. It is essentially a stock market simulator. You trade with fake money, but everything else is real: real stock prices, real market conditions, real timing. Think of it as a flight simulator for investing. Pilots do not learn to fly by jumping into a Boeing 747. They practice in simulators first. Paper trading works the same way.\nThe beauty of paper trading is that you can make mistakes without consequences. Want to test a risky strategy? Go ahead. Curious what would happen if you put everything into one stock? Try it. You learn the lessons without the financial pain. For someone like me who had already learned that lesson the expensive way, paper trading felt like a second chance."

We get greedy when prices rise. We chase trends, follow tips from friends, and convince ourselves that this time is different. These emotional decisions add up over time, eating into returns.\nProfessional trading firms figured this out decades ago. They use algorithms. Computer programs that execute trades based on predefined rules. No emotions. No hesitation. Just data and logic.

The idea is based on an observation that has held up over decades of market research: stocks that have been going up tend to keep going up, at least for a while. It is not magic. It is just pattern recognition.\nMy bot would look at how stocks performed over the past few months. If a stock was in an upward trend, buy it. If it started falling behind, sell it and move to something else. No predictions about what a company is “really worth.” No reading earnings reports. Just following the trend.\nDid it work? Sort of. In backtesting, where you simulate the strategy on historical data, it actually beat the market in several periods. But here is the catch: it also had some brutal losing streaks. Momentum strategies get crushed when markets suddenly reverse. This was my first lesson in why professional quants spend so much time thinking about risk."

Could a model learn patterns in stock data that I could not see? The answer, it turns out, is complicated.\nI experimented with a method called XGBoost. Without getting too technical, it works by asking a series of questions about the data and combining the answers. Is the stock trading above its recent average? Is trading volume unusually high? Has the broader market been trending up? Each question helps narrow down whether a stock is likely to rise or fall.\nThe exciting part: the model did find patterns. Certain combinations of factors seemed to predict short-term movements better than random chance. The humbling part: those patterns are fragile. A model trained on 2020 data might completely fail in 2024. Markets evolve. What worked yesterday might not work tomorrow. This is why paper trading matters so much.

    "text": "The Hidden Cost That Nobody Talks About\nHere is something that surprised me. Many strategies that look profitable on paper actually lose money in practice. The reason? Transaction costs.\nEvery time you buy or sell a stock, you pay fees. They might seem tiny, maybe a few dollars per trade. But if your strategy trades frequently, those fees add up fast. A strategy that trades daily might generate hundreds of transactions per month. Even at a few dollars each, you could easily pay thousands in fees. Suddenly, your “12% annual return” becomes 4%. Or negative.\nThis was a humbling realization. The slickest algorithm in the world means nothing if it trades so often that fees eat up all the profits. One of the most valuable things I learned was to account for realistic costs before getting excited about any strategy."

But it also will not notice when the world changes and your strategy becomes obsolete. You still need to pay attention.\nSecond, backtesting is not the same as real performance. Historical data is the past. Markets are always adapting. A strategy that worked beautifully in 2015 might fall apart today.\nThird, simple often beats complex. My basic momentum strategy, despite its flaws, was easier to understand and debug than my fancy machine learning model. When something went wrong, I could actually figure out why.\nFourth, paper trading is genuinely useful. I made dozens of mistakes in my simulator that would have cost real money otherwise. The learning curve is steep, and it is much better to climb it with fake dollars."
