## Land Acknowledgement {.center }

I wish to acknowledge that we gather and study on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded lands of the **xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam)** and **Sḵwx̱wú7mesh (Squamish)** Nations.

I am thankful for the privilege to learn, work, and grow on this land.

## The Problem: Humans Are Terrible Investors {.center}

In early 2024, I watched my stock drop **15% in one day**.

I panicked. I sold everything.

Next week? It bounced back **20%**.

. . .

**Why do we do this?** Because we're human:

- We **panic** when prices drop
- We get **greedy** when prices rise
- We chase trends and follow tips

*Most individual investors underperform a simple index fund.*

## The Solution: Let a Robot Decide {.center}

### What I Built

**Paper Trader AI** - Three strategies competing head-to-head:

1. **Momentum** - Follow the trend
2. **XGBoost** - ML pattern recognition
3. **LSTM** - Deep learning predictions

All trading S&P 500 stocks with fake money, real prices.

*Think of it as a flight simulator for investing.*

### Key Performance

| Strategy | Return |
|----------|--------|
| **Momentum** | **+18.0%** |
| XGBoost (ML) | +6.8% |
| LSTM | +7.7% |
| SPY Benchmark | +3.4% |

. . .

::: {.highlight-box}
**The Hidden Lesson:** XGBoost made **576 trades** vs Momentum's **50 trades**.  
More trades = more fees = lower returns. Less is More.

## Key Takeaways {.center}

::: {.fragment}
1. **Automation removes emotion, but not risk**
   - The bot won't panic sell, but markets still change
:::

::: {.fragment}
2. **Simple strategies often beat complex ones**
   - My basic momentum strategy outperformed fancy ML models
:::

::: {.fragment}
3. **Transaction costs are the silent killer**
   - That "great" strategy might just be feeding the brokers

. . .

## The Bottom Line
Now when my portfolio drops, I remind myself:

**The robot wouldn't care. Maybe I shouldn't either.**
